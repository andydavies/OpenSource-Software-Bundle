'compat' directory contains code or workarounds for different functions/data structures that
are unavailable or differ across MacOSX versions:

 * tree.h - rbtree implementation copied from OpenBSD. SDK has this header only starting from version 10.7.
 * exchange - exchange vnop is not a part of public kernel API, so we mimic its implementation
